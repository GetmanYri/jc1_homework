A regular expression,  specified 2 as a  string, must first  be compiled into an  instance of this class.
The resulting  pattern can then be used to create4 a Matcher  object  that12 can match arbitrary
character sequences  against  the regular expres55sion.
All of the state  involved in  performing a match resides in the matcher,
so many matchers  can share the  same pattern.
